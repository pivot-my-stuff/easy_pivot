EASY PIVOT INSTALLATION
-----------------------
1. Make sure your query code stores its results into a SQL Server
   temporary table (Preferably, it should be a local temporary
   table instead of a global one. Local temporary tables start with
   a single hash mark instead of two for global ones). For example,
   "#my_source_table".

2. Append the easy_pivot code from template file "easy_pivot.sql"
   to your existing query code.

3. In the following line of Easy Pivot code, change the name of the
   "#car_prices" local temporary table to the name of your table:

    Before:
        DECLARE @source_table AS NVARCHAR(MAX)= '#car_prices'

    After:
        DECLARE @source_table AS NVARCHAR(MAX)= '#my_source_table'

4. Specify your group fields and pivot fields in the Easy Pivot
   configuration section:

   Example:

       DECLARE @config AS NVARCHAR(MAX) = '
           [
               {
                   "Group": [
                       "COUNTRY"
                   ],
                   "Pivot": [
                       {
                           "Pivot_Field": "COMPANY",
                           "Pivot_Data": "PRICE",
                           "Pivot_True": null,
                           "Pivot_False": null,
                           "Pivot_Type": "SUM",
                           "Follows_Field": "COUNTRY",
                           "Sort_Order": "ASC"
                       },
                       {
                           "Pivot_Field": "COLOR",
                           "Pivot_Data": null,
                           "Pivot_True": "Yes",
                           "Pivot_False": "No",
                           "Pivot_Type": "MAX",
                           "Follows_Field": null,
                           "Sort_Order": "ASC"
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ]
   '

   The Easy Pivot configuration uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   format to record your selections. Quoted text before the colon (":")
   indicates what you need to configure, while quoted text after the
   colon represents your actual choices (i.e., you need to change these
   text items).

   Group configuration:
       "Group": ["MY_GROUP_FIELD_1", "MY_GROUP_FIELD_2"]

   (These are fields your pivot is grouped on.)

   Pivot configuration:
       "Pivot": [
           {
               "Pivot_Field": "MY_PIVOT_COLUMN_FIELD",    (Turn this field's data into column names)
               "Pivot_Data": "MY_PIVOT_DATA_FIELD",       (Turn this field's data into column data)
               "Pivot_True": null,                        (Used to generate "Yes" or "True" column data)
               "Pivot_False": null,                       (Used to generate "No" or "False" column data)
               "Pivot_Type": "SUM",                       (Data aggregate function: "SUM", "COUNT", "MAX", etc.)
               "Follows_Field": "MY_GROUP_FIELD_1",       (Place this pivot's column names after this group field)
               "Sort_Order": "ASC"                        (Sort this pivot's column names by ASC or DESC order)
           }

   Note: Use "null" for choices you do not use. Do not place quotes around it:

   Example: "Pivot_True": null,

   (Also, make sure there are commas between the curly-brace pairs
   when configuring multiple pivots.)

5. Run your combined query work plus Easy Pivot! There is no checking
   by Easy Pivot to validate your group and pivot choices (This would
   increase the size of the Easy Pivot code). The worst that can
   happen is there will be errors or no results. In those cases,
   double-check your Easy Pivot configuration settings. The most
   common cause of problems is placing the same field name in both
   the group and pivot configuration settings.

   The field names in your temporary table should be unique. Use
   the AS syntax in the SELECT section of your query code to make all
   field names unique if necessary. Easy Pivot will not work if any of
   the field names are the same.

   In SQL Server Management Studio, Easy Pivot will not work if the
   database is the default "master" database. So if you want to run
   one of the provided examples, change to a database that you
   normally work with before running.
